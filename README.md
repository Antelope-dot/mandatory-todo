# Mandatory todo app
Everyone has to start some where, and what better way of starting than making a classic todo app!

Made this project to get a better understanding of react and E2E testing.

Stylsheet from [here](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/react-todo-list)

## Stack
React + TypeScript + Vite

Cypress

## Running program and tests
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Antelope-dot/mandatory-todo.git
$ cd mandatory-todo
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```
Tests can be run with
`
npx cypress run
`

(Note: Requires app to be running. For some reason tests run with Firefox fail while the app works perfectly fine in the browser)
